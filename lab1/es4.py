"""
The RSA Cryptosystem: an example
Now, suppose Alice wants to encrypt the plaintext 9726
to send to Bob. She will compute 97263533 mod 11413
and send the ciphertext c over the channel.
- Please determine câ€™s value using the square and
multiply algorithm (Algorithm 6.5 at slide #10 )
When Bob receives the ciphertext c, he uses his secret
decryption exponent a to compute the plaintext sent by
Alice.
