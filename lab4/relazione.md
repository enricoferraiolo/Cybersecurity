# Detect the intruder

> It has been detected that an intruder has visited a webpage with an html extension. Analyze the traffic and find the flag, that has this format CCIT{flag} from the s3cret.pcapng file.

We used Wireshark to analyze the traffic in the s3cret.pcapng file. We first filtered the packets with a simple filter (http contains "CCIT"), not finding anything. 

We then proceeded to search for any http packet that contains ".http" in the URI. We found a packet that contained the following information:

```
GET /it/sedi/bologna/informazioni.html HTTP/1.1
```

We then followed the HTTP stream to find the corresponding response, revealing the flag:

```
